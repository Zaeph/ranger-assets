Dear ranger co-author,

first I would like to thank you for contributing to the ranger project at some
point, whether it was just a single, small bug fix or a large set of commits.
Every bit helps, and you helped to turn ranger into what it is today!  A file
manager with tens of thousands of users and over 2000 stars on GitHub.  One
that sets a high bar for all the console file managers to come.  You can be
proud of yourself.

There is however one mistake that has been made when the project was initiated:

We can not easily switch to an updated version of the GPL, because the license
text explicitly specifies "GPL 3", without the commonly used phrase "or any
later version".  Back then, I believed this to be the right choice.  After all,
GPL 4 could change so drastically that I wouldn't agree with it anymore, and I
wouldn't want my software to be distributed under its terms & conditions.

But the world of free software moves ahead and we need to stay on top of our
game.  Civil liberties are taken from us every day and we have to fight with
every weapon that we have.

That's why I want to change the license to the upgraded GPL 3.1 [0]. And since
you have contributed to the project, I need your permission to do that!

Please reply and tell me whether you accept that I distribute your contribution
to ranger under the new license or not.  If you disagree, please be aware that
your code may be removed from ranger if the majority of contributors agree to
the switch.  I hope we can discuss any concerns and come to an agreement that
is most beneficial for the community.

Regards,
hut
